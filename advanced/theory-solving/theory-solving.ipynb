    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to modify the application `app.py` and implement a lazy version of clingo-dl that uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us explain this step-by-step. Observe that the propagator `DLPropagator` of `app.py` implements the function `propagate` of the `Propagator` interface but not the function `check`. The function `propagate` is called at every propagation phase of the CDCL solving algorithm of clingo. In this call the propagator considers the set of different constraints that are true in the current partial assignment, and tests if that set is satisfiable. If that is not the case then it adds a corresponding nogood to the solver. The test is implemented in the function `add_edge` of the class `Graph`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of this project is to modify the propagator so that it implements the function `check` instead of the function `propagate`. In this way, the propagator will only test total assignments and not partial ones. Hence we say that this is a lazy version of clingo-dl. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step concerns the implementation of the satisfiability test of a set of difference constraints. \n",
    "Instead of using the current method, in this project you have to use the Bellman-Ford algorithm. You still have to check if the graph induced by a given set of difference constraints contains negative cycles, but now you have to implement that check using the Bellman-Ford algorithm."
