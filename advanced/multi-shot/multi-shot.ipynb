    "# Problem Description.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based in the sections about clingo applications\n",
    "and multi-shot solving of the paper [1].\n",
    "Before starting, we recommend you to read them carefully.\n",
    "The idea of the project comes from the paper [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "* [1] Kaminski, R., Romero, J., Schaub, T., & Wanko, P. (2020). How to build your own ASP-based system?! CoRR, abs/2008.06692.\n",
    "* [2] El-Kholany, M. M. S. & Gebser, M. (2020). Job Shop Scheduling with Multi-shot ASP. TAASP 2020.\n",

    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to solve the Job Shop problem in ASP using multi-shot solving.\n",
    "For this, you have to write a clingo application in `Python` and an ASP encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project extends the project on `scheduling` that you can find at the parent directory.\n",
    "Please finish that project before starting with this one.\n",
    "In that project you had to write an ASP encoding for solving the Job Shop problem.\n",
    "In this project you will extend your previous work to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Job Shop problem every job consists of some operations that have to be performed in a given sequence.\n",
    "In this project, we assign to every operation its earliest starting point,\n",
    "i.e., the sum of processing times of predecessor operations belonging to the same job.\n",
    "The operations of a job could be processed at their earliest starting times if the machines were free.\n",
    "However, machines may be occupied by operations of other jobs,\n",
    "so that the earliest starting times merely provide a lower bound on the actual starting times of the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given some facts about the predicates `duration/3` and `sequence/3`\n",
    "describing an instance (see the `scheduling` project for more information)\n",
    "the earliest starting point `E` of the operation of job `J` on machine `M`\n",
    "can be defined by the following rule:\n",
    "```\n",
    "est(J,M,E) :- sequence(J,M,S), E = #sum{DD,MM,SS : sequence(J,MM,SS), SS<S, duration(J,MM,DD)}.\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "In this project, we will split the set of all operations into time windows based on the earliest starting time.\n",
    "Given an instance with `o` operations and `w` time windows,\n",
    "the `i`-th time window for `1 <= i < w`\n",
    "includes the operations at positions from `(i-1)*o/w + 1` to `i*o/w` (where `/` represents the integer division)\n",
    "and the `w`-th time window includes the operations at positions from `(i-1)*o/w + 1` to `o`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this decomposition, the operations have to be scheduled window wise, using multi-shot solving.\n",
    "First, the operations for time window `1` must be optimally scheduled (solving a logic program).\n",
    "Then, those operations should be fixed (using the functions about externals), and \n",
    "the operations for time window `2` must be optimally scheduled (again, solving a logic program).\n",
    "The process should continue in this way until the operations of all time windows have been scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the approach does not guarantee to find an schedule that is globally optimal.\n",
    "This is the price that we pay for the expected improvement of the overall solving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we give some hints on the ASP encoding and the `clingo` application."
