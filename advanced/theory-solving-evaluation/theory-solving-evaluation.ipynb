    "Each operation uses one machine during a given time, and\n",

    "A machine can only process one operation at a time, and\n",
    "some operations may have to wait until their corresponding machine is free.\n",
    "Different operations of the same job use different machines, and\n",

    "* any processing order of the jobs on the machines is allowed.\n",

    "This means that different jobs may perform the operations in different orders, and \n",

    "The second part of the task is to evaluate the performance of the different encodings and systems. \n",
    "In the evaluation you have to run the different encodings (with the corresponding systems) and the provided instances (see below), and analyze the results. The analysis should try to answer the questions: \n",
    "* for each solution, what is the relation between its solving time and the instance size?\n",
    "* is there a solution that is always faster than the others, or this depends on the instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about an explanation for the results that you obtain, and feel free to extend the analysis.\n",
    "If you have done the project on `theory-solving`, you should also evaluate the implementation of `clingo-dl` that is part of that project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you have to write a report about your work and do a presentation of it.\n",
