The first part describes the possible components of a product and their attributes.\nFor example, a bike must have a front wheel and a rear wheel of some size, and it may have a bag with some number of pockets.\n2. The second part describes some constraints over the components.\nFor example, one constraint can be that the size of the wheels of a bike must be the same.\n\nThe input may also contain a selection of components of the product and some of their attributes.\nThis selection may be complete or incomplete.\nFor example, the input may contain a complete selection of the components of a bike,\nor just consist of a selection of wheels.\n\nThe task of product configuration is to\nfind a possible configuration of the product that is consistent with the given selection.\nIf there is no such possible configuration,\nthen the output should explain why there is no possible configuration.\n\n## Clinguin\n\nClinguin is an extension of clingo to create interactive User Interfaces (UIs) using ASP.\n\nUIs are defined as sets of atoms, which are then rendered by a frontend, and \nprovide continuous interaction with an ASP solver based on user-triggered events.\n\nThe documentation about clinguin is available here:\n* https://clinguin.readthedocs.io","metadata":{},"id":"4eb4e160-6eb3-451b-98e5-21e7a1350585"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Resources\n\n## COOM Language\n\nCOOM is a language for product configuration. \nIt covers the first part mentioned above: \n1.
